        <p> How to link images</p>
        <p>but it was really big so I googled how to make it smaller on the page</p>
        <img src="img/week1_notepage1.jpg"
                width="500" />
        <p> I want to know if I can use variables to scale it to the relitive size of the screen. but I know that If I only define the width that it'll automaticly scale the height. </p>
        <p> I hope I'll learn to use css in the future, because this page is lowkey ugly.</p>
        <p> This code.org exercise is the first time I ever got to learn programming back when I was a tiny boy. I made steve to crazy things</p>
