    <h1>And I fell</h1>
    <p>
        Honestly its around here I fell off. I don't know what happend. I just died a little bit. I killed it in the first trimester, like the best grades I ever got accross the board in uni was in that trimester. But all good things come to an end. I think I may have burnt out, I just felt so appathetic, everything piled up around me. It all came to an end. I missed a bunch of dead lines, now I've got my fingers crossed that I won't fail everything.
