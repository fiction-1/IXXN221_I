    <h1>Domain-ating it</h1>
    <p>
        In this post I figued out subdomians! I bought my domain <a href="https://adamfrom.com" target="_blank">adamfrom.com</a> and configuired it for another class. Then on the google domain dashboard I figured out how to add subdomains to github pages. It's remarkably easy, its only one extra enrty in the DNS records. So that means even though the page was initally an ugly github url now its beautifull. When I tested it at uni I ran into issues where it was.
