        Honestly I enjoyed this course, espeially once I started digging into the blog. I am most greatful from this course that I learnt to use html and css on a basic level. I made a website that I put on the on the internet. I can look things up and figure out maybe how to make it work if its html or css. I really appreciate that. Even though I feel off in the end, thats an awesome skill I would love to keep up.
