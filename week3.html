    <h1>lowcarbon design</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.lowww.directory/">These guys talk about lowcarbon design</a> and honestly I'm kind of a fan. I like the very minimalist design and how its a way to live out my values in a carbon consuming world. There is a lot of potentiel and maybe my personal site could be carbon nuteral. It also helps that I don't know much so I can keep it lowkey easier. I wonder if it could include like low data but use methods to still deliver results, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger">fps game that is one kilobyte</a> but actually consumes many resources. It's cool and I like the idea.
