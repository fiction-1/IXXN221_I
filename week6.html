    <h1>I went to a birthday party once</h1>
    <p>
        In the middle of the trimester I went to a birthday party. It was my sisters 18th. It was important to me that I was there but it honestly cost me a bit. I was stressed with uni, I stayed up late working on assignments and I was behind the whole time. I came back to wellington and was tired, so I wanted to rest. I missed two classes for webdesign in person that because of that. The next post talks about my downfall a little bit. Rest assured my gpa is taking a hit into oblivion.
