    <h1>bad habits lead to late nights</h1>
    <p>
        I think part of my downfall is having bad habits. My downfall is that I fell of the uni wagon towards the end, handed in my assignments late and am worried about failing my courses while also not caring and so fourth. I take full responsibilty for that, it isn't a win, but its on me. Bad habits like staying up late and maybe epecially poor boundries around non uni activitites and bad rest all contribute to the problem like they contribute to this awful run on sentence. It all fell apart and I'm still in it and its time to deconstruct it. 
        <br><br>
        I'll do that later.
        <br><br>
        But I will take a break from uni. Set better habits, start a sport. Honestly I'd be keen to join a drama club. Make new friends.
