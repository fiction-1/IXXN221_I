        I'm hosting this website on github, you can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/fiction-1/IXXN221_I">here</a>. I'm using it for hosting, but its also cool to follow along and see whats up. Like learning how to use it and stuff. It's really helpful and I feel like its a foot in the door.
