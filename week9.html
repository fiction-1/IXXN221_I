    <h1>dreams</h1>
    <p>
        My dream is to make a cool website to present my photography. I'm not an amazing photographer, but I really enjoy it and think it would be cool to show people. Have a way to showcase my work online without relying on a third party site like flikr, instagram and stuff like that.
